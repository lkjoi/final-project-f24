Narrator : this is a story about an explorer named Steve Irwin(no relation)  finding a new animal species. Our story takes place in a mysterious forrest 

Steve: hey explorer (name) glad to have you! we have a lot to do so let’s get started. 

there is a river with crocodiles under neath solve this math question to build a bridge; if you get it wrong croco food

Question 1: what is 20 x 30 -120 + 5? 

Steve : great! We got passed our first road block and i found a clue (Steve points a rainbow colored feather) 

Narrator : steve and the explorer continue down the forest as they continue to search for their prize….

Steve: Oh No!!  an anaconda trapped us, quickly use the knife in my back pocket to cut it. 

Question 2: solve this question to use the knife! : what is Log base 4 (2) + Log base4(8)

Steve: whew that was close!! Glad you where there. Look ! A mountain our bird should be up there

Narrator: Our hero steve and explorer wasting no time hastily try to climb up the mountain. It went as well as you thought 

Question 3: to climb the mountain solve this question:  find the derivative of 12x/3+x^2

Steve: we did it!!!!!(jayson tatum meme). And there we are with our bird! Look how beautiful it is!

Narrator: despite the explorer doing everything steve takes the credit for finding the bird and names it after himself . He gave you credit for helping him though i guess

Question 4: time to catch the bird. Solve this question and your quest ends : find the limit as x approaches 3,(-x^4+2x^2-4)

Narrator : it turns out the catching an animal isn’t easy and steve unsurprisingly doesn’t help at all. 

Question 5: you know the drill. Complete this question to subdue the bird: Log base 6(216) + Log base 6(36) 

Narrator: The bird has been caught . You can finally end and go home since you’re getting nothing else outta this at least get a picture. 

Question: solve this for a picture: the derivative of Tan(x) 
The End
