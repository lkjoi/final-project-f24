# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Still deciding on it 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Making a visual novel on renpy 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I don't know if we will have music, but we will surely draw our artwork.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO Having a working story from beginning to end without having any errors.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Having more than one ending and many other choices in the story.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO Maybe like having some kind of game in the story to make it more interesting 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO 
Brainstorm what kind of story and how the story will go
Watching some video on how renpy work 
We haven't decided on individual roles yet, but eventually, one of us will handle the coding while another will focus on the story plot and visuals.
